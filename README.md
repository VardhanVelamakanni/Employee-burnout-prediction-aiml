A machine learning model to predict emplyee burnout prediction 
The Employee Burnout Prediction project leverages a linear regression model in machine learning to predict burnout levels among employees based on key workplace factors such as workload, job satisfaction, and work-life balance. Developed as part of an Artificial Intelligence internship at Edunet Foundations, this project aims to provide organizations with insights into potential burnout risks, enabling them to take proactive measures to improve employee well-being and productivity. The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting burnout levels accurately.
